# Emulator Changelog

**Independent from the HA integration's `manifest.json` version.**
The emulator under `esp_emulator/` evolves at its own cadence — bug
fixes, new brand-emulation coverage, and protocol-fidelity work happen
here without touching the integration's release cycle, and vice versa.
Emulator releases are tagged `emu-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-14 — Persistence: state survives reboots + cup counters tick

A real machine remembers its water level and cup counters between power
cycles. The emulator now does too.

### Added

- **`niv_consum` NVS namespace** — `nivona_consumables` persists the
  full state (water / beans / tray / filter levels + brew_unit /
  trays / powder_lid part presence) on every change and restores on
  init. No persisted blob → factory defaults (all tanks full).
- **`niv_fam` NVS namespace** — `nivona_family_set` writes the last-
  selected family key; `nivona_family_current` lazily restores on
  first call. Default on fresh NVS: NIVO 8000. Boot after `family 700`
  now re-advertises as NICR 759 / emits process=8 codes without
  needing to repeat the CLI command.
- **Cup counter tick** — `brew_task` on successful completion
  increments `HR stat_id = 200 + selector` (per-recipe) and `213`
  (total_beverages) via the existing NVS-backed `nivona_store`. HA's
  Nivona stat sensors (declared in `brands/nivona.py::_STATS_*`)
  finally return non-zero values — `sensor.*_espresso`,
  `sensor.*_total_beverages` etc. tick up on every brew.
- **`factory_reset` CLI command** — wipes the four emulator-owned NVS
  namespaces (`niv_num`, `niv_alpha`, `niv_consum`, `niv_fam`) and
  reboots. Does NOT touch WiFi creds or NimBLE bonds — use `forget`
  for the latter.

### Binary

ESP32-C6 clean build, 1.32 MB (+1.6 KB over `emu-v0.4.0`; still 13 %
partition headroom).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-14 — Phase D: realistic consumables + maintenance FSM

Third slice of the Nivona full-emulation roadmap. The emulator now
simulates a real machine's wear: brewing consumes water and beans,
fills the drip tray, and eventually the corresponding prompts
(`FILL_WATER` / `EMPTY_TRAYS` / `BU_REMOVED`) appear in HA —
clearable only by refilling via CLI (or a real physical refill
once community testers have hardware).

End-to-end flow HA users now experience:

1. `brew 3` on a 900-family emulator → GRINDING → COFFEE → STEAM ramp.
2. After ~25 brews the water tank drops under 10 % — emulator raises
   `FILL_WATER` in the next HX.
3. HA's `binary_sensor.*_awaiting_confirmation` turns on; the user
   taps "Confirm Prompt" → emulator receives HY, NACKs (hard prompt).
4. Dev runs `fix water` on the serial CLI → tank back to 100 %,
   `nivona_maint_reevaluate` clears the prompt, next HX reads
   `manipulation = NONE`.
5. Brew resumes normally.

### Added

- **`nivona_consumables.{h,c}`** — simulated levels for `water`,
  `beans`, `tray`, `filter` (each 0–100 %) and three mechanical
  parts (`brew_unit`, `trays`, `powder_lid`). Thresholds in the
  header (e.g. `NIVONA_THR_WATER_LOW = 10`).
- **`nivona_maint.{h,c}`** — maintenance orchestrator. Re-evaluates
  consumables on every state change, picks the highest-priority
  manipulation, handles HY confirm (soft vs hard), exposes
  per-family allowlist (`has_milk_system` → `MOVE_CUP_TO_FROTHER`;
  1030/1040/8000 → `CLOSE_POWDER_LID` + `FILL_POWDER`).
- **Cold-start sequencer** — on boot, if no hard prompt, raises
  `FLUSH_REQUIRED` as a soft prompt (cleared by HA's first HY).
- **CLI commands**:
  - `tank <name> <pct>` — set consumable level.
  - `fix <name>` — refill / re-seat (`water`/`beans`/`tray`/
    `filter`/`all`/`brew_unit`/`trays`/`powder_lid`).
  - `part <name> <on|off>` — mechanical part present/absent.
  - `tanks` — dump all levels and parts.

### Changed

- **\[BUG FIX\]** `nivona_fsm.h` `nivona_manipulation_t` enum rewritten
  to match the canonical `Manipulation` IntEnum from
  `const.py:141`. Previously the emulator emitted `MANIP_WATER_EMPTY
  = 1`, which HA parses as `BU_REMOVED = 1` — silently wrong
  manipulation entities. Legacy CLI aliases (`trigger water_empty`
  → `FILL_WATER`) kept working.
- **`brew_task`** consumes resources per stage (GRINDING −3 % beans
  +2 % tray, COFFEE −3 % water, WATER −5 % water, STEAM −3 % water)
  and calls `nivona_maint_reevaluate` at the end so prompts surface
  in the final HX of the brew.
- **`nivona_brew_start`** refuses HE while a hard prompt is active
  (water empty / tray full / BU removed) — matches real-hardware
  behaviour and lets the Nivona app surface a proper error.
- **`handle_he`** NACKs when `nivona_brew_start` refuses — previously
  only NACKed on unknown selector.
- **`handle_hy`** routes through the maintenance orchestrator:
  soft prompts clear, hard prompts NACK until consumables fix
  the underlying condition.

### Requires

- HA integration **v0.46.0+** for brand-aware HX parsing.

### Binary

ESP32-C6 build clean, 1.31 MB (13% partition headroom). +~5 KB
over `emu-v0.3.0` for consumables + maintenance FSM.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-14 — Phase C-lite: per-family brew recipes + multi-stage ramp

Second slice of the Nivona full-emulation roadmap (see
[`../docs/NIVONA_RE_NOTES.md`](../docs/NIVONA_RE_NOTES.md) §Phase
C-lite). HE brew is now family- and recipe-aware: unknown selectors
are rejected with NACK, and milk-capable recipes walk a proper
GRINDING → COFFEE → STEAM sequence via `sub_process` transitions
instead of a single flat ramp.

### Added

- `nivona_families.{h,c}` gained full per-family recipe tables
  (RECIPES_600 / 700 / 79X / 900 / 1030 / 1040 / 8000), mirroring
  `custom_components/melitta_barista/brands/nivona.py::_RECIPES_*`
  so the C and Python sides stay in sync.
- `nivona_recipe_category_t` enum (ESPRESSO / COFFEE / AMERICANO /
  MILK_DRINK / MILK_ONLY / WATER) and per-category brew ramps
  (stage list + total wall-clock).
- `nivona_family_recipe_by_selector()` — lookup helper used by both
  brew start (resolve category) and HE handler (validate selector).

### Changed

- **`nivona_brew_start(selector)`** now resolves the selector against
  the active family's recipe table. Unknown selector → returns `false`,
  which causes the HE dispatcher to reply NACK. Previously any
  selector byte was silently accepted.
- **`brew_task`** walks recipe-category stages, setting `sub_process`
  per stage:
  - ESPRESSO / COFFEE / milk-less: `GRINDING → COFFEE`
  - AMERICANO: `GRINDING → COFFEE → WATER`
  - MILK_DRINK: `GRINDING → COFFEE → STEAM`
  - MILK_ONLY: `STEAM` only
  - WATER: `WATER` only

  Progress percentage (0–100) is linear across the whole brew.
  Durations are heuristic (espresso 20s, milk drink 45s, etc.) and
  await verification against a real-machine BLE trace.
- **Dispatch `handle_he`** replies NACK when `nivona_brew_start`
  refuses the request (unknown selector / brew in progress).

### Requires

- HA integration `v0.46.0+` (brand-aware HX parsing for `sub_process`
  transitions to render correctly on non-8000 families).

### Binary

ESP32-C6 build clean, +1.8 KB over emu-v0.2.0 (still 13% partition
headroom).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-14 — Phase A: per-family FSM process codes

First slice of the full Nivona emulation roadmap (see
[`../docs/NIVONA_RE_NOTES.md`](../docs/NIVONA_RE_NOTES.md)).

### Added

- `main/nivona_families.{h,c}` — canonical per-family lookup table
  covering 8 known Nivona families (600/700/79x/900/900-light/1030/
  1040/8000) with `ble_name`, `model`, `process_ready`,
  `process_brewing`, `fluid_scale`, and `has_milk_system` fields.
- `nivona_fsm_reset_to_ready()` — retargets the FSM to the active
  family's READY code without requiring a reboot.

### Changed

- `nivona_fsm_init` reads from the active family entry instead of
  hardcoding `process = 3`.
- `nivona_brew_task` snapshots the current family at brew start and
  uses its `{process_brewing, process_ready}` codes for the ramp.
- CLI `family <key>` command now also calls `nivona_family_set` +
  `nivona_fsm_reset_to_ready` — previously only ADV / DIS were
  updated, FSM codes stayed locked to NIVO 8000 regardless of
  selected family.

### Fixed

- Emulator was functionally broken for any family other than `8000`.
  After `family 700` the ADV identified NICR 759 but HX kept
  returning `process = 3` (NIVO 8000 READY). With HA v0.46.0+
  brand-aware parsing expecting `8` for non-8000 Nivona families,
  status sensors would render as "unknown".

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-13 — Initial emulator (bundled via HA integration v0.44.0)

First working Nivona BLE emulator:

- Byte-exact advertisement matching a real machine (company ID
  `0x0319`, Eugster customer payload, AD00 service, DIS in SR).
- GATT: AD00 (AD01 write, AD02 notify) + DIS (0x180A) with
  manufacturer/model/serial.
- Full Eugster/EFLibrary encrypted protocol: frame parser, RC4 stream
  cipher, AES customer-key bootstrap, HU handshake with per-brand
  verifier, HR/HW/HX/HE/HA/HB opcodes.
- HX FSM (hardcoded NIVO 8000 codes at this stage), HE brew ramp,
  unsolicited HX notifications during brew.
- CLI-driven family switch (ADV/DIS only — FSM codes fixed until
  0.2.0).
- WiFi CLI + telnet + OTA.
- Targets: ESP32-C6 (primary) and ESP32-S3.

Shipped alongside HA integration releases 0.44.0 → 0.48.1 as an
in-tree asset; from 0.2.0 onwards the emulator has its own tag series.
